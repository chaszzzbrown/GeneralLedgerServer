Documentation for General Ledger Service.

The service is broken into two apps:

gllaunch: which handles just the launch part of the operation

gldata: which handles the database api both for ProblemDefinitions, and for SessionData.

gllaunch API:---------------------

really, only one URL here:

<home>/gllaunch/launchTool/

This is the URL called by TPI as a POST, with a slew of key/value pairs that define what's going on. 

We grab the custom_resultid and user_id, perform an MD5 hash on their concatenation, and use that as the unique session_id.

We get or create a SessionData record using that key; and save ALL of the key/val;ues that were posted to us by TPI.

We then redirect to the APP_REDIRECT_URL in the settings.py file; and go to:

/#/<session_id>/

The app never uses the gllaunch service; all data requests etc. are via the gldata service.

gldata API --------------------------

<home>/get_session_data/<session_id>/
	method: GET
	returns a JSON encoded object with attributes:
		session_id - the session id
		launch_mode - the launch mode (do, review, etc)
		launch_data	- dict containing ALL the TPI launch params
		session_state - initially, an empty object; the app determines what gets put in here.
		
<home>/put_session_state_data/<session_id>/
	method: POST
	parameters: 
		session_state
	
	Stores the JSON encoded data for the app. Returns an error if it's not valid JSON, else just 'OK'

<home>/create_problem_definition/<problem_guid>/
	method: POST
	creates an empty problem definition; Returns an error if this is a duplicate; else OK. Really just for testing;
	should use put_problem_definition for both creating and editing problems.

<home>/put_problem_definition/<problem_guid>/
	method: POST
	parameters:
		problem_data: JSON encoded object with all the problem data, except for the correct answers.
		correct_data: JSON encoded array of correct answers
		
<home>/put_problem_definition/<problem_guid>/
	method: GET
	returns a JSON encoded object with 2 attributes
		problem_data: JSON encoded object with all the problem data, except for the correct answers.
		correct_data: JSON encoded array of correct answers
	Use this ONLY during authoring; student should not be able to peek at correct answers!

<home>/get_problem/<problem_guid>/
	method: GET
	returns the JSON encoded problem data for the problem.

<home>/grade_problem/<problem_guid>/
<home>/grade_problem_and_report/<session_id>/<problem_guid>/
